## **Description**

F﻿inding the right professor for the course you wish to take is hard. [Rate My Professors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/) does an ok job but it can be better. First, Choose My Professor maps its search from courses to professors so you can immediately view all the professors who teach a given course. Second, Choose my Professor does NLP sentiment analysis on every review for a professor's class to give you meaningful insights at a glance. Instantly get a vibe check on a professor's course to plan your schedule accordingly. Choose My Professor solves the problem of connecting students with professors who align with their academic goals.

## **Role**

I had a vision for Choose My Professor as a part of a semester long practical AI/ML project as a part of the CS1699 course at the University of Pittsburgh. I collaborated with three other students at the University of Pittsburgh and was the team lead for this project.

## **Skills Utilized**

\-﻿ NLP
-﻿ Python
-﻿ nltk
-﻿ Flask
-﻿ AWS
-﻿ javascript
-﻿ React
-﻿ Github
-﻿ Netlify
-﻿ Selenium

## **Contribution**

As team lead for this project, I managed delegation of tasks and ensured that all our deadlines for the project were met. From a programming perspective, I coded up the whole frontend with React, worked on fine tuning our models, wrote a flask API to serve model predictions, and hosted our flask API on AWS.

## **Outcome**

\-﻿ Received A+ in CS1699 Course
-﻿ Working project demo hosted publicly [Site](https://choose-my-professor.netlify.app/)

## **Key Takeaways**

F﻿rom this project I learned how to manage other developers to cultivate a collaboration where each individual' skills compliment the others to achieve outcomes I could not have otherwise reached on my own.

A﻿nother key learning from this project came when observing the cold starts that AWS lambda gives when serving our API. The project is in need of a database since currently everything is loaded into memory and takes a significant amount of time. I learned that engineering decisions regarding performance are critical to the usability of an application.
